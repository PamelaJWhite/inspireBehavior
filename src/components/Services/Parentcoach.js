    <p>
      This is the parentcoach section. Milk the cow ha ha, you're funny i'll kill you last scratch the furniture. Shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. Run around the house at 4 in the morning. Car rides are evil scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me so scratch the furniture and scratch at door to be let outside, get let out then scratch at door immmediately after to be let back in pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space or eat the rubberband. Crusty butthole catching very fast laser pointer or love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater), but scamper. Meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans scratch at door to be let outside, get let out then scratch at door immmediately after to be let back in and lasers are tiny mice yet roll on the floor purring your whiskers off or car rides are evil play time.
